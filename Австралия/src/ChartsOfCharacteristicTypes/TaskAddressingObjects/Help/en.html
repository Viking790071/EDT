<p>This is the list of application objects that can be used for <a href="InformationRegister.TaskPerformers/Help">role-based addressing</a> purposes together with the <a href="Catalog.PerformerRoles/Help">performer roles</a>. </p>
<p>Opened by the matching command of the <strong>Business processes and tasks</strong> section.</p>
<p>The list includes the following columns:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Description</strong>. Full description of an address object. </li><li><strong>Value type</strong>. A value type of an addressing object.</li></ul><p>Depending on the specifics of business processes, <a href="Task.PerformerTask/Help">tasks</a> can be addressed to a performer or to a group of performers both personally (personal addressing) and, for some <a href="v8help://1cv8/EnterprWorkingWithBusinessProcesses_StandardInterface">business processes</a>, using business process roles (role addressing).</p>
<p>In case of role addressing, assignment is not issued to the performer, but to a certain role of the business process (for example, <strong>Room supervisor</strong>). Specifying, main, and additional addressing objects can be used. For example, the <strong>Project manager</strong> role can have the main <strong>Department</strong> addressing object and additional <strong>Project</strong> object. Thus, addressing objects help to clarify to which project managers and in which department the task is assigned. The map of performers to roles and addressing object is set before starting work with business processes and tasks, and it is used by the application for delivering instructions to specific performers. </p>
<p>The <strong>All addressing objects </strong>predefined item covers all addressing objects available in the application.</p>
