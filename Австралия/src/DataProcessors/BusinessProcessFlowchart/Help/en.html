<p>Opened from the <a href="InformationRegister.BusinessProcessesData/Help">My business processes</a> list or from the business processes window (for example, <a href="BusinessProcess.Job.Form.BusinessProcessForm/Help">Jobs</a>) by clicking <img src="StdPicture.BusinessProcess"></img><strong>Route map</strong>.</p>
<p>The procedure of <a href="v8help://1cv8/EnterprWorkingWithBusinessProcesses_StandardInterface">business process</a> execution can be visually represented as a flowchart. The flowchart presents internal logic and lifecycle of a business process as a sequence of route points. Each route point represents a business process stage usually consisting of a single operation. Whenever a business process reaches a route point that requires action by a specific performer, a <a href="Task.PerformerTask.Form.BusinessProcessTaskForm/Help">task</a> is created. Once the performer marks the task as completed, the business process automatically proceeds to the next route point. In this manner, the completion of business process <a href="Task.PerformerTask/Help">tasks</a> progresses to completion.</p>
<p>When working with the application, the current flowchart status can be displayed for a business process, including both completed and active route points. Completed route points are marked by hatch.</p>
<p>At each route point, one or more actions are available that change the business process status.</p>
