<p>Details of performer role properties.</p><a name="СтандартныеПодсистемы.Пользователи">
</a><p><a name="СтандартныеПодсистемы.Пользователи"></a><a href="Catalog.PerformerRoles/Help">Performer roles</a> can be used in <a href="v8help://1cv8/EnterprWorkingWithBusinessProcesses_StandardInterface">business processes</a> for role-based <a href="Task.PerformerTask/Help">task</a> routing purposes. In this case, tasks are initially assigned to roles (example: <strong>Room supervisor</strong>) rather than to a specific performer. Map of <a href="Catalog.Users/Help">users</a> and roles are defined in the<a href="InformationRegister.TaskPerformers/Help"> Roles and task performers</a> list, on which basis the tasks are automatically reassigned to specific users. </p>
<p>However, in certain cases, the performer role is not enough to accurately identify the performers. In these cases, you need to specify the main and additional <a href="ChartOfCharacteristicTypes.TaskAddressingObjects/Help">addressing objects</a>. For example, the <strong>Project manager</strong> role can have the main <strong>Department</strong> addressing object and additional <strong>Project</strong> object. Thus, addressing objects help to clarify to which project managers and in which department the <a href="Task.PerformerTask.Form.BusinessProcessTaskForm/Help">task</a> is assigned.</p>
<p>The list of roles is included in the application, but can be expanded if necessary.</p>
