<p>Designed for performer role selection.</p>
<p>Opened by clicking <strong>Select</strong> from the <strong>Performer role</strong> field of <a href="v8help://1cv8/EnterprWorkingWithBusinessProcesses_StandardInterface">business processes</a> and the window of performer roles selection.</p>
<p><a href="Catalog.PerformerRoles/Help">Роли исполнителей</a> могут использоваться бизнес-процессами для ролевой маршрутизации <a href="Task.PerformerTask/Help">задач</a>. In this case, tasks are initially assigned to roles (example: <strong>Room supervisor</strong>) rather than to a specific performer. Map of <a href="Catalog.Users/Help">users</a> and roles are defined in the<a href="InformationRegister.TaskPerformers/Help"> Roles and task performers</a> list, on which basis the tasks are automatically reassigned to specific users. However, in certain cases, the performer role is not enough to accurately identify the performers. In these cases, you need to specify the main and additional <a href="ChartOfCharacteristicTypes.TaskAddressingObjects/Help">addressing objects</a>. For example, the <strong>Project manager</strong> role can have the main <strong>Department</strong> addressing object and additional <strong>Project</strong> object. Thus, addressing objects help to clarify to which project managers and in which department the <a href="Task.PerformerTask.Form.BusinessProcessTaskForm/Help">task</a> is assigned.</p>
<p>The map of performers to roles and addressing object is set before starting work with business processes and tasks, and it is used by the application for delivering instructions to specific performers. </p>
<p>The list of roles is included in the application, but can be expanded if necessary. </p>
<p>Roles with no performers assigned are colored in red. It is not recommended to allow such situations as it can lead to the emergence of tasks that are not completed on time. The <a href="Report.HungTasks/Help">Hung tasks</a> report is designed to control such tasks. </p>
<p>The list includes the following columns:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Description</strong>. Full role description. </li>
<li><strong>Short presentation</strong>. Short description of a role for your convenience. By default, <strong>Code</strong> is automatically copied into this field. </li>
<li><strong>Code</strong>. Filled automatically. </li>
<li><strong>Comment</strong>. Role details are displayed at the bottom of the list.</li></ul><h3>Performer role choice</h3>
