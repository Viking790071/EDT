<p>Use this list to configure rules for automatic <a href="Catalog.ReportsOptions/Help">report</a> generation and delivery.</p>
<p>You can open the list by clicking <strong>Report distribution rule sets</strong> in <strong>Service subsystems</strong> section.</p>
<p>The application features a variety of reports. Users often require the same report periodically. For example, a manager might need a daily report on mutual payments state. A CEO might need a weekly report on a company's key financial indicators.</p>
<p>Report distribution rule sets automate this process. Users get the reports they need by email or from a shared folder, without the need to run the application.</p>
<p>You can create multiple report distribution rule sets. A rule set usually groups several report types or recipients, or features specific periodicity.</p>
<p>For example, a report distribution rule set can include reports intended solely for a CEO and top managers. Another rule set can contain daily reports that are sent to some employees. A third rule set can contain reports sent to counterparties upon their request.</p>
<p>Once you configure a rule set, you can schedule the report distribution using the "Report distribution" <a href="DataProcessor.ScheduledAndBackgroundJobs.Form.ScheduledJob/Help">scheduled job</a>, or send them manually.</p>
