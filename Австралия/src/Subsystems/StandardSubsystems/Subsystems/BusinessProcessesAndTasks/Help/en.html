<p>Business processes are used to organize separate application operations into interconnected operation chains intended to achieve specific goals. </p>
<p>The procedure of busines process execution can be visually represented as a flowchart. The flowchart presents internal logic and lifecycle of a business process as a sequence of route points. Each route point represents a business process stage usually consisting of a single operation. Whenever a business process reaches a route point that requires action by a specific performer, a <a href="Task.PerformerTask/Help">task</a> is created. Once the performer marks the task as completed, the business process automatically proceeds to the next route point. In this manner, the business process progresses to completion. For user convenience, the current flowchart status can be displayed for a business process, including both completed and active route points.</p>
<p>A <a href="Task.PerformerTask/Help">task</a> can be assigned to a specific user or user group (personal addressing), or to a specific business process role (<a href="InformationRegister.TaskPerformers/Help">role addressing</a>). Please keep in mind that roles as related to business processes and roles as related to access rights management are two separate logical entities. In case of role addressing, tasks are assigned to business process roles (example: Room supervisor) rather than to specific users. Associations between users and roles are defined in the <a href="InformationRegister.TaskPerformers/Help">Roles and performers list</a>, on which basis the tasks are automatically reassigned to specific users. A predefined role set is distributed together with the application.</p></body></html>
